Welcome to the Columbia Book Exchange project repository! Both our frontend and backend live under this repo.

Our backend requires `flask` and `flask-cors`, so make sure that these are installed. If you have
`pip` installed you can navigate to the `backend` folder and then enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install both at once. To start the backend, run `app.py` from the backend directory. Note that we are assuming the backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. This is important because we will be calling this endpoint in our React frontend.

Our frontend requires `axios` so enter `npm install axios` to ensure this is installed. To run the frontend, run `npm start` from the frontend directory.
