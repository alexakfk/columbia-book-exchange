Welcome to the Columbia Book Exchange project repository! This repository contains both the frontend and backend for our application.

Our backend requires `flask` and `flask-cors`, so make sure that these are installed. If you have
`pip` installed you can navigate to the `backend` folder and then enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install both at once. To start the backend, run `app.py` from the backend directory. Note that we are assuming the backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. This is important because we will be calling this endpoint in our React frontend.

Our frontend requires some dependencies so run `npm install` to ensure these get installed. Next, start the frontend by running `npm start` from the frontend directory.
